## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates force measurement using an FSR sensor and Arduino (Uno R4 recommended).

The system:

- Reads analog force data
- Converts raw ADC values
- Displays structured output
- Implements input validation
- Follows Doxygen documentation standards
- Enforces Git-based development discipline

This project introduces:

- Analog sensor interfacing
- ADC (Analog-to-Digital Conversion)
- Data acquisition systems
- Embedded system structuring

---

## 🔧 Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Uno R4
- Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR)
- 10kΩ Resistor (Voltage Divider)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- USB cable

---

## 💻 Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Git
- GitHub Account

## 🔌 Wiring Connections (Voltage Divider Setup)

| Component | Connection |
|------------|------------|
| FSR One Pin | 5V |
| FSR Other Pin | Analog Pin A0 |
| 10kΩ Resistor | Between A0 and GND |

⚠ FSR must be connected using a voltage divider configuration.

## ⚙ Sensor Working Principle

- FSR resistance decreases when force increases.
- Analog voltage changes.
- Arduino ADC converts voltage to digital value (0–1023).
- Force estimation is derived from ADC value.

---

## 🧠 Code Structure

The system:

1. Initializes Serial communication
2. Reads analog value from A0
3. Converts raw ADC reading
4. Prints formatted force data
5. Applies threshold detection
